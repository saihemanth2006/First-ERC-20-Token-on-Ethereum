What I Learned
Through building MyToken, I learned:

✔ How ERC-20 tokens work
The purpose of mappings like balanceOf and allowance
How transfer and transferFrom maintain token movement
Why events like Transfer and Approval are crucial

✔ Smart Contract Development in Solidity
Writing functions with require validations
Managing state variables and mappings
Emitting events after state changes

✔ Using Remix IDE
Compiling and deploying smart contracts
Testing with JavaScript VM accounts
Viewing transaction logs and debugging errors

✔ Blockchain Concepts
How addresses interact with contracts
How tokens maintain balances
How decentralized approval systems work
This project was my first step into blockchain development, and it helped me understand the real mechanics behind popular cryptocurrencies.
